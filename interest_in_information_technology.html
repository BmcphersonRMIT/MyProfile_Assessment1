      <p>My earliest experience with technology would’ve been when I was a child; I was playing sonic the hedgehog on the Sega Master System. I don’t remember being very good, but it was the blue mascot and the soundtrack that enticed me. This is what lead to my love for video games and technology. Another fund memory was when my father and I would jump onto the internet, we would have to connect to dial up and hearing that iconic sound. </p>

      <p>As I’ve always had an interest with computers, it wasn’t until I was 16 years old that I discovered that you could earn money by working with computers. I signed up for school-based work experience and began my first taste of working in IT. The job was at an engineering firm in the IT department. The tasks that were assigned for me were basic, but it was the people whom I worked that inspired me to pursue a career in Information Technology.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Fast forward to now, 28 and have been working in IT full time for 7 years as an Information Systems Support Analyst, I still very much enjoy working in IT but have become undecided on which path in IT to take and specialize in. Networking has appealed to me since I’ve started my career, but it wasn’t until I had to develop a script to automate user account creations where I’ve discovered what programming was. The euphoria of building something and getting to work is the best feeling and this is when I knew that I wanted to seriously consider programming as my career.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Despite all this, my intentions for enrolling with RMIT is to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology to learn new skills, build on existing knowledge and ultimately find what it is in IT that I want to do. </p>
