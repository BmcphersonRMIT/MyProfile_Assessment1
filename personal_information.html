      <p>My name is Brandon, and was born in Brisbane, Australia. Still currently living in Brisbane which is convenient for work which is also located in the city. Indy is my cat, and she has been in my life since I was 13 years old, she has been a great companion. Some of my hobbies include reading, playing video games, watching football (soccer), seeing friends, and travelling.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This year, I’ve finished ready a great book called “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” by Yuval Noah Harari which I strongly recommend reading. It goes into detail on the origins of humankind and how we’ve shaped the modern world. History is important to me because if we don’t learn from the past, we are doomed to repeat it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As I am living in Brisbane, I have been fortunate not to be impacted by lockdowns. Occasionally I’ve had to work from home, which is challenging as it can feel quite confined. Once the borders are opened again and have completed my study, I plan to travel overseas to Europe. </p>
